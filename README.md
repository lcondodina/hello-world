## Lily Condodina
I am a senior Busiess Analytics major and Sociology minor at the University of Notre Dame. I am originally from New Jersey, and my favorite hobbies include reading, skiing, running, and baking. Here on campus, I run the Student Union Board and work for NDListens where I call and engage with alumni of the University.
